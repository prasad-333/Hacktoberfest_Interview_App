### üéÉüéÉLEVEL 3 CONTRIBUTIONSüéÉüéÉ - BUILD A MODULE OF THE PROJECT :O!! YOU'RE A BOSS!

Want a challenge? Here you will rebuild the project with options to use the supplied UI. You will focus on showing off a few different libraries and
an architecture of your choice (MVP, MVC, MVVM, HILT, Coroutines, etc etc etc endless possibilities) To show other developers different ways in which
these things can be combined to build the quiz application. Please focus on and gain experience with the repository layer, dependency injection, view
models, and whatever else you like!
Lets see how many different modules we can create!

1. navigate to `https://github.com/Tc2r1/DevInterview_Questions/tree/master/Interview_Prep_App/`
2. decide if you want to work in Native_Java or Native_Kotlin, or something else (for something else skip to 6b) open the folder you choose.
3. Fork the repo and create a branch to save your work to.
4. copy the template application folder, paste it into native_kotlin folder, and rename it based on what your project will showcase. for example "retrofit, coroutines, viewmodel, jetpack
   compose" along with your username (IE:
   retrofit2_tc2r1)

5. Open the "Interview_Prep_App" folder in android studio and add your module to the settings.gradle file.
6. Rename the module id com.interviewprep.unique_folder_name_from_step_3 6b. For those who want to work in something besides native android, create a
   folder with your application type in `Interview_Prep_App` folder: "SwiftUI" "Html5" etc.

7. Use your skills and libraries of choice to recreate the project.
8. Pull latest changes from master branch into your branch and resolve all merge conflicts.
