## files here only serve the purpose to help search engine optimization by adding code of different languages to this repository so that it shows up when github and google users search for a project to contribute to using one of those said languages. 

### The Hope is that by having code from those languages here, the Issues that require work in the actual project repo in those said languages may get seen by developers who use that said language.

As code from said language is added to the project (most likely in the form of modules) these files will slowly be deleted.
